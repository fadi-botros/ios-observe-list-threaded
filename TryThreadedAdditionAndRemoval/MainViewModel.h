 Here is the core of the action.
 An object that observes on the datasource, any change in the datasource must be reflected, but how?
 There IS an array here, that STORES the current state, any change are put on a dispatch queue
 Then the UI is to be updated and this update will be on the same queue, this will make the changes
 intermittent, not direct, but as real-time as possible
